# .gitattributes for AI-102 Course Repo
# This file enforces consistent line endings and file handling across platforms.
# See: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes

# --- Core Rules ---

# Use LF (Unix-style) for all code, scripts, and markdown for maximum compatibility
*.js     text eol=lf      # JavaScript source code
*.json   text eol=lf      # JSON config/data files
*.ts     text eol=lf      # TypeScript source code
*.py     text eol=lf      # Python scripts
*.sh     text eol=lf      # Shell scripts (critical for Linux/WSL)
*.md     text eol=lf      # Markdown docs
*.yml    text eol=lf      # YAML config/workflows
*.yaml   text eol=lf
*.env    text eol=lf      # Environment files

# Use CRLF (Windows-style) only for Windows batch files
*.bat    text eol=crlf    # Windows batch scripts

# Images and binaries should be treated as binary (no line ending conversion)
*.png    binary
*.jpg    binary
*.jpeg   binary
*.gif    binary
*.ico    binary
*.pdf    binary

# --- Explanations for Learners ---
# - 'text eol=lf': Always use LF line endings (best for cross-platform dev)
# - 'text eol=crlf': Use CRLF only for Windows batch files
# - 'binary': Prevents Git from trying to convert line endings in images/binaries
#
# Why? Consistent line endings prevent bugs, merge conflicts, and script failuresâ€”especially when collaborating across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
