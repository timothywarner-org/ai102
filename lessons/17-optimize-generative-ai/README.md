# Lesson 17: Optimize Generative AI Models

## Subtopics
- 17.1 Customize pre-trained models for unique use cases
- 17.2 Integrate generative AI into applications
- 17.3 Implement orchestration and reflection in agent workflows with Semantic Kernel and Autogen

## Code Samples

### node-demo
Simple command line utility that calls an Azure OpenAI deployment.

1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your Azure OpenAI details.
2. Run `node generate.js "Your prompt"` inside the `node-demo` folder.

The script prints the model's generated text.
