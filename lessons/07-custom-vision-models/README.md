# Lesson 7: Create Custom Computer Vision Models

## Subtopics
- 7.1 Train and deploy custom vision models
- 7.2 Test and optimize models for domain-specific tasks

## Code Samples

### node-demo
A minimal Node.js script that sends an image to an Azure Custom Vision model for classification.

1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and add your Custom Vision credentials.
2. Run `node app.js <path-to-image>` inside the `node-demo` folder.

The script outputs predicted tags and probabilities.
