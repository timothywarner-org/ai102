# Exam AI-102: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution


## Lesson 14: Deploy Knowledge Mining Solutions

Let's make a simple Express / React web app that has:

- search box and drop-down list controls for faceted search
- upload box to accept a form upload

We are calling the Azure AI Search and Doc Intelligence services 

Present a formatteed report page for each scenario

I'm using the built-in hotel sample project for Azure AI Search.

Brand the website to make the hotel search and upload boxes plausible from an ai-102 standpoint.

i put the service keys and endpoints in .env

If you need anything else from me, please ask!

Question: I want this particular solution contained in the repo-root folder /ai-search-document-intelligence. If that isn't so, please make it so.
