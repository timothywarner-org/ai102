  - Open an issue using the GitHub Issues tab.
  - Be explicit: include steps to reproduce, screenshots, or links if possible.
  - Tag your issue (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `question`).

### 2. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
- **Ready to make a change?**
  - Fork the repo and create a new branch (`feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-fix`).
  - Make your changes, following the code style and structure of the repo.
  - Add or update documentation and `.env.sample` files as needed.
  - Test your changes locally.
  - Open a PR against `main` with a clear, descriptive title and summary.
  - Reference any related issues in your PR description.

### 3. Add a New Demo App or Lesson Example
- Place new code in the appropriate `lessons/XX-lesson-title/` folder.
- Include a README.md with:
  - What the demo does
  - Setup instructions
  - Required environment variables (add to `.env.sample`)
  - Any teaching notes or troubleshooting tips

## 🧑‍🎓 Code Style & Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Prefer environment variables over hard-coded secrets or endpoints.
- Follow the repo's `.gitattributes` and `.env.sample` conventions.
- Write accessible, neurodivergent-friendly documentation.
- Keep PRs focused—one fix or feature per PR is best.
