## 🚀 Copilot Prompt Engineering for Node & Azure AI
- **Be explicit:** Start prompts with what you want (e.g., "Write an Express route for..." or "Implement a function to call Azure OpenAI...").
- **Context matters:** Copilot works best when you include relevant code, comments, and variable names nearby.
- **Use docstrings:** Add JSDoc or TypeScript comments above functions to get better completions.
- **Break down tasks:** Ask for one function or class at a time for focused, high-quality code.
