# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, neurotype, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Delight, clarity, and accessibility are core values here.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting radical acceptance and neurodivergent-friendly communication
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing up as your authentic self (quirks welcome!)

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project lead (Tim Warner) at [tim@techtrainertim.com](mailto:tim@techtrainertim.com) or via Discord (timwarner1). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
